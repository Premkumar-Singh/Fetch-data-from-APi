# Fetch User Data with Fetch API

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a simple web application that demonstrates how to use the **Fetch API** in JavaScript to retrieve and display user data from a public API. It pulls user information (name, email, and address) from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and renders it in a styled HTML layout.
